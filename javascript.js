//javascript.js
//central javascript file that is going to be the Hub of all the other files
//This basically means that this will controll what all the other files do and make
//
//The reason for this is so that we can have multiple files that have their own purpose
//but keep the simplicity of the uses in here
//
//Say we have a file specifically for the character and it contains a class to form it
//we can use this to A.) create and B.) change what the character does
//
//I don't know and can't really tell if we are going to be doing it in all one file
//or if Lamorrie is gunna have us do it spread out but either way its just a file
